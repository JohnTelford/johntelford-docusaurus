## Deep Technology Dives

I have been deep technology diving website frameworks over the years.
I have reincarnated [JohnTelford.com](johntelford.com) and [TechTalkJohn](techtalkjohn.com) websites using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools). 

Some out-of-the-box missing features I was looking for in deep technology dives were:
- Sidebar Menu
- Automatic date of file last update
- File tags
- An integrated blog
- JSX embedded Markdown

The frameworks I experienced did not have these out-of-the-box features.

## Docusaurus
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework has the out-of-the-box features, so I reincarnated [JohnTelford.com](johntelford.com) and [TechTalkJohn](techtalkjohn.com) websites using Docusaurus 

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static-site documentation site generator. It is an open-source website framework created by Facebook. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

### out-of-the-box

Some of the out-of-the-box features I am using are:

#### Components

- Powered by React and MDX
- JSX embedded in blog and MDX documents
- Extend and customize with React
- Modern [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) documentation

#### Development

- Hot web browser reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
- Route-based code and data splitting
- Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
- Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel and other deployment services

#### Files

- An integrated blog
- Automatic file last update date
- File tags

#### User Experience

- Full site is searchable using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com)

- Sidebar Menu
	- Website and blog pages
	- MDX files Table of Contents
