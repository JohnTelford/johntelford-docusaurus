:::caution Work in Progress
:::

:::note

This website is an example of using  *Iterative Development*  technology for the latest of JohnTelford.com [Reincarnations](/blog/reincarnation) 

:::

## Prerequisites

### Define

Learn the realities of  *Iterative Development* technology by doing  a deep  dive of recasting JohnTelford.com website

### Design

The  Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction perquisites requirements will use the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework.

:::note

What is important to me is a framework abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and web media  is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper)


I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools). I used [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework to build this website

## Overview

Developing  is  translating *Define* and *Design* processes into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations sometime during the life time of the website.

## Iterative Development Stack


:::note

The *Iterative Development Stack*  delivers fast page loading  with a consistent look and feel.

The *Iterative Development Stack* is device agnostic. What works for  big screens, works for  small screens.

### GitHub Central repository

:::note

GitHub is a Microsoft company

:::

The key *Iterative Development* technologies are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous versions. It helps answer the questions **who changed what, where, when, and why?**

All team members have their own local copy of the central project repository. They make changes, fix defects, add new features to their repository, without interfering with others team members, or the central  repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the  repository with their changes, to private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine some  changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, they will be pushed to central project repository, and team members update their  local copy by pulling the central  repository changes into their local repository. This process keeps team members up to date.

### VScode

:::note

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a Microsoft product.

It has become  the goto editor for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.

:::

VScode is the command and control center for the website project.

Some of the development command and control tasks are:

- Editing code and  web media 
- Use `git` and `GitHub` to manage project files. `Git`is built-in and optimized to work with Microsoft `GitHub`
- Editor  tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors
- Live edit previews show how edits will look when deployed
- Deploy secure website previews to the Internet for stakeholders
- Deploy production website to the Internet
- Built-in command shell
- And **much** more

## Web Components
 
This site is built using web components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)  is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

    - Some features I like are:
        - Powered by MDX
        - Extend and customize with React
        - Hot reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
        - Route-based code and data splitting
        - Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
        - Blog MDX files
        - Blog and file:
            - Side Menu
                - Project
                - Blog posts
            - MDX files Table of Contents

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) in MDX documents. One can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components built with JSX and other React components.

## Deployment

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features) supports static site hosting services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ,  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and others. I have used these and other hosting services. My choice is Vercel.

This site is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) Global [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for deployment. Their motto is *Develop, Preview, Ship*.

:::note

Some benefits  deploying project with Vercel are: 

- Performance
- Ease of use

:::

Some features I like are:
- Automatic deploys after a push to the GitHub repository.
    - Production website
    - Team member deploy to a secure website
- Command line deployments using the `vercel` app.
- Builds are quick, especially those with few changes.
- Redeploy previous deployments and look at the code used to generate them.

## Tools

### Hardware

The primary hardware tool for web development is [Workstations](workstations). They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large or multiple screens, and work with web software development applications

### Software

Some tools that help detect software defects early are:
- `vscode` extensions
- `SiteLinkChecker` app
- `Fork` quickly checks repository commits and file changes
- [iA Witer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12) It is a Markdown Writing App:
    - Faster way to write MDX web media 
    - Extensive Style Check
    - Focus
        - Sentence
        - Paragraph
