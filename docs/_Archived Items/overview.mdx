Creating websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.

:::

## Content

People visit websites for the content. They have little interest in how the content is created or how it gets to their screen. Most access the website using mobile devices. They and others have little tolerance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not
conform to their screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, functionality, need to be consistent and complement the content.

This website discusses optimizing website project life time costs. It describes a framework for developing and deploying websites. It is based on _Iterative Development_ and _web component technologies_.

Iterative website development enables the _Define, Design, Develop, Deploy and Maintain_ teams to be be operational at the same time, including testing and remediating defects.

## Iterative Development Teams

:::note

Teams work together delivering their work to other teams for the lifetime of web site.

The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations during the life time of the website.

:::

### Define

- The _Define_ team prerequisites are what the project is about, funding, purpose, functionality, stakeholders, content, _must_ and _want_ features, and security.

### Design

- The _Design_ team prerequisites are making decisions about Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction.

### Develop

- The _Develop_ team perquisites are making decisions about resources required to transform the _Define_ and _Design_ work into a website, and infrastructure. This includes Development Framework and programming tools.

### Deploy

- The _Deploy_ team perquisites are

  - Making decisions about what resources are required for deploying production version of the website to the Internet.

  - Making decisions about what resources are required for team developers working on features, fixes, or testing to deploy private Internet websites with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version.

### Maintain

- The _Maintain_ team perquisites are making decisions about remediating _Define_, _Design_,_Develop_, _Deploy_, or _Security_ defects.

## Defect Remediation Costs

Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

Some of the early defect detection mechanisms built into the framework are:

- `vscode` editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors
- Fast refresh live-editing quickly show changes while typing, and any runtime errors
- Team members may frequently deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback.

## Minimum Viable Product

The first goal of the project is get to a _Minimum Viable Product_. It is a way to understand whether the website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in product development with the _must_ features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

The next steps are adding the _want_ features, until stakeholders agree the website is ready to be deployed to the Internet.
