## Prerequisites

Website design perquisites are making decisions about , *Responsive Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction*.

The perquisites requirements for this website are realized using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework. Any of the Docusaurus attributes may be changes.

:::note

It is important  a framework  abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and website media  is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper). These attributes provide means to create user interface, and decreases the time to create or port website media.

## Responsive Website Design

The majority of users access websites using mobile devices. They and others have little tolerance for slow loading website pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size.

Website design  ensures pages load quickly and adjust to display size. Website pages are display correctly on a variety of devices and window or screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, and functionality maintain consistency.
