## Prerequisites

Website design perquisites are making decisions about , *Responsive Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction*.

The perquisites requirements for this website are realized using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework. Any of the Docusaurus attributes may be changes.

:::note

It is important  a framework  abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and website media  is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper). These attributes provide means to create user interface, and decreases the time to create or port website media.
