:::note

This website is an example of using  *Iterative Development*  technology for the latest of JohnTelford.com [Reincarnations](/blog/reincarnation) 

:::

## Prerequisites

The Develop team perquisites are making decisions about resources required to transform the *Define* and *Design* work into a website, and infrastructure. This includes development [framework](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools) and programming tools.

---

## Overview

Developing  is  translating *Define* and *Design* processes into website pages using abstract logical structures, rigid nonhuman website programming languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations sometime during the life time of the website.

---

## Iterative Development Stack

:::note

The *Iterative Development Stack*  delivers fast page loading  with a consistent look and feel.

The *Iterative Development Stack* is device agnostic. What works for big screens, works for  small screens.

### GitHub Central repository

:::note

GitHub is a Microsoft company

:::

The key *Iterative Development* technologies are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous file versions. It helps answer the questions **who changed what, where, when, and why?**

All team members have their own local copy of the central project repository. They make changes, fix defects, add new features to their repository, without interfering with others team members, or the central  repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the  repository with their changes, to a private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine some changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, they will be pushed to central project repository, and team members update their local copy by pulling central  repository changes into their local repository. This process keeps team members up to date.

### VScode

:::note

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a Microsoft product.

It has become the goto editor for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.

:::

VScode is the command and control center for the website project.

Some of the development command and control tasks are:

- Editing code and  website media
- Use `git` and `GitHub` to manage project files. `Git`is built-in and optimized to work with Microsoft `GitHub`
- Editor  tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors
- Live edit browser previews show how edits will look when deployed
- Deploy secure website previews to the Internet for stakeholders
- Deploy production website to the Internet
- Built-in command shell
- And **much** more

## Vercel

This site is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) Global [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for deployment. Their motto is *Develop, Preview, Ship*.

Vercel builds the website and deploys when `git` pushes changes from the *Local Repository* to the *Central Repository*, *Vercel* then automatically builds the website and deploys to the Internet.

Another way is using the Vercel Command Line Interface (CLI) that builds the website and deploys it.

---

## Website Components
 
This site is built using website components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static-site generator. It is an open-source website framework created by Facebook. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

    - Some features I like about Docusaurus are:
        - Powered by MDX
        - Extend and customize with React
        - Hot web browser reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
        - Route-based code and data splitting
        - Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
        - Blog MDX files
        - Blog and file:
            - Side Menu
                - Website project
                - Blog posts
            - MDX files Table of Contents

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) components in MDX documents. One can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components.

## Tools

### Hardware

The primary hardware tools for website developers are [Workstations](workstations). They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large or multiple screens, and work with website software development applications

### Software

Some tools that help detect software defects early are:
- `vscode` extensions
- `SiteLinkChecker` app
- `Fork` is a quick way to checks repository commits and file changes
- [iA Witer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12) is a Markdown Writing app:
    - Faster way to write MDX website media 
    - Extensive Style Check
    - Focus
        - Sentence
        - Paragraph

---

### iA Writer

Editing Markdown / MDX website pages and blog posts using iA Writer seems to be faster because of focus and grammar features with live preview.

When one or more pages have been edited using iA Writer, the  [ChronoSync](https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html) app is used to synchronize files from iA Writer to `vscode`. Since the macOS iA Writer files are store in iCloud, they can be edited remotely using Mac laptops, iPhones, or iPads.
