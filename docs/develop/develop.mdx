## Prerequisites

### Define

Learn the realities of  Iterative Development technology by doing  a deep  dive of recasting JohnTelford.com website

### Design

The  Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction perquisites requirements are resolved by using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework.

:::note

I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools)

What is important to me is a framework abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and content is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper)


## Overview

Developing websites is akin to translating *Define* and *Design* processes into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security  will require remediations during the life time of the website.

Web programming is not easy. It is complex, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical.

## Responsive Web Design

The majority of website are accessed by users using mobile devices. They have little tollarance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size.

Website designs must ensure pages load quickly and adjust from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability. Web pages must display correctly on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size, and the website look and feel, users experience, and functionality must maintain consistency.

## Iterative Development Stack

The *Iterative Development Stack*  delivers fast page loading  with a consistent look and feel.

:::note

The *Iterative Development Stack* is device agnostic. What works for  big screens works for  small screens.

### Central repository

A key Iterative Development technologies are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous versions. It helps answer the questions _who changed what, where, when, and why?_

All team members have their own local copy of the central project repository. They make changes, fix defects, add new features to their copy of the project repository, without interfering with others, or the central project repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to a private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine some repository changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, the central project repository will be updated, and team members update their own local copy of the central project repository.

<!--
Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their users. The cost of error and security remediation, may cost a magnitude or more money than creating the websites.

### VScode

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a Microsoft product that has become  the goto editors for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.


The key web software development tasks are editing, use source control system to managing edits, live edit previews, secure web site previews for stakeholders, and deploy to the production web site.

## Web Components
 
This site is built using web components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)  is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) in MDX documents. You can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components built with JSX and other React components can be imported in MDX.

## Tools

The primary tool for web development are [ Workstations](workstations). They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large or multiple screens, and work with web software development applications
