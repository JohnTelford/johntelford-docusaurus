This website is an example of using  Iterative Development  technology for the latest of JohnTelford.com [Reincarnations](/blog/reincarnation) 

:::

## Prerequisites

### Define

Learn the realities of  Iterative Development technology by doing  a deep  dive of recasting JohnTelford.com website

### Design

The  Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction perquisites requirements are resolved by using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework.

:::note

I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools)

:::

---

What is important to me is a framework abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and content is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper)


## Overview

Developing  is  translating *Define* and *Design* processes into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security  will require remediations sometime during the life time of the website.

## Iterative Development Stack

The *Iterative Development Stack*  delivers fast page loading  with a consistent look and feel.

:::note

The *Iterative Development Stack* is device agnostic. What works for  big screens works for  small screens.

### GitHub Central repository

A key *Iterative Development* technologies are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous versions. It helps answer the questions _who changed what, where, when, and why?_

All team members have their own local copy of the central project repository. They make changes, fix defects, add new features to their it, without interfering with others team members, or the central  repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the  repository with their changes, to private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine some  changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, they will be pushed to central proect repository, and team members update their  local copy by pulling the central  repository changes into their local repository. This process keeps team members up to date.

### VScode
:::note

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VScode) is a Microsoft product that has become  the goto editors for many. It is free, built on open source, and runs everywhere.


:::

VScode is the command and control center for the website project.

Some of the development command and control tasks are:

- Editing code and text matter
- Use `git` and `gitHub ` to manage project files
- Use live edit previews to see how edits will look when deployed
- Deploy secure website previews to the Internet for stakeholders
- Depoly production website to the Internet
- Built-in command shell

## Web Components
 
This site is built using web components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)  is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make  site interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

    - Some features I like are:
        - Powered by MDX
        - Extend and customize with React
        - Hot reloading with  fast incremental build on changes
        - Route-based code and data splitting

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) in MDX documents. You can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components built with JSX and other React components, can be imported in MDX.

## Deployment

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features) supports static site hosting services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ,  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and others.

This site is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

## Tools

The primary hardware tool for web development are [ Workstations](workstations). They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large or multiple screens, and work with web software development applications
