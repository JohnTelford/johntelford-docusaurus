_Web Development Components For The Component Era_ - Web Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) functions, but work in isolation.

Web  components are a set of web platform APIs that enables creating new custom, reusable, encapsulated [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library or framework that works with HTML.

Web components are based on existing web standards. They enable web developers to extend [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook.

> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library. It enables creating complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

> React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element. A component is the core building block of a React application. Every component resides in the same space, but works independently from one another and merges all them in a parent component, which is the final UI of the application."

## React JSX

The core development technology of Next.js and React is [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). React has created JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. JSX is not part of the web programming languages troika. Browsers do not understand JSX. React created a compiler to transform JSX code into standard JavaSript
at build time.

> JSX (JavaScript XML), is a React syntax extension to the JavaScript language. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. It is similar in appearance to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are written using JSX.

> React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

> Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with cohesive components that contain both.

> ❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.
>
> 💻 Everything is a component: Use existing components inside MDX file and import other MDX files as plain components.
>
> 🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.
>
> 📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains, JSX is interleaved when you want to.
>
> 🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage."
