## Prerequisites

### Define

Learn the realities of  Iterative Development technology by doing  a deep  dive of recasting JohnTelford.com website

### Design

The  Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction perquisites requirements are resolved by using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework.

:::note

I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools)

:::

What is important to me is a framework abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) and content is created using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) with [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper)
