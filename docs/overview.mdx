Creating websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.


This website discusses optimizing website project life time costs.  It describes a  framework for building and deploying websites. It is based on *Iterative Development* and *web component technologies*.

---

## Content

People visit websites for the content. Most access the website using mobile devices. They and others have little tolerance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not 
conform to their screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, functionality, also need to be consistent and complement the content.

## Iterative Development Stack

:::note

The *Iterative Development Stack* is device agnostic. What works for  big screens works for  small screens too.

:::

The *Iterative Development Stack*  delivers fast page loading  with a consistent look and feel using [Responsive Wed Design](design/design#responsive-web-design)

### Central repository

A key Iterative Development technologies are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Teams can view history of all changes and go back to previous versions. It helps answer the questions _who changed what, where, when, and why?_

All team members have their own local copy of the central project repository. They make changes, fix defects, add new features to their copy of the project repository, without interfering with others, or the central project repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to a private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine some repository changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, the central project repository will be updated, and team members update their own local copy of the central project repository.

<!--
Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their users. The cost of error and security remediation, may cost a magnitude or more money than creating the websites.

## Defect Remediation Costs

Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

Some of the early error detection mechanisms built into the framework are:

- Automatic tools in the `vscode` editor  continually check for syntax and other errors 
- Fast refresh live-editing quickly show changes while typing, and any runtime errors
- Team members may frequently deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback.

## Minimum Viable Product 

 The first goal of the project is get to a Minimum Viable Product. It is a way to understand whether a product idea will work or not. It is a stage in product development with the *must* features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.
 
 The next steps are adding the *want* features, until stakeholders agree the website is ready to be Version 1 and deployed to the Internet.

## Iterative Development

### [Define](define/define)

Defining website results contribute to *Develop*


### [Design](design/design)

Website *Design* creates the look and feel *Develop* builds 


### [Develop](develop/develop)

Developing websites is akin to translating *Define* and *Design* into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations during the life time of the website.


### [Deploy](deploy/deploy)

Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.


### [Maintain](maintain/maintain)

Maintain is remediating *Define*, *Design*,*Develop*, *Deploy*, or Security problems.
