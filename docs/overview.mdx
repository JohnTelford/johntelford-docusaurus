Creating websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.


This website discusses optimizing website project life time costs.  It describes a  framework for developing and deploying websites. It is based on *Iterative Development* and *web component technologies*.

Iterative website development enables the *Define, Design, Develop, Deploy and Maintain* teams to be be operational at the same time including testing and remediating defects.

## Iterative Development Teams

The Iterative website development teams are:

### Define

- Websites Define prerequisites are what the project is about, funding, purpose, functionality, stakeholders, content, and security

### Design

- Website design perquisites are making decisions about , Responsive Web Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction.



### Develop

- Developing websites is akin to translating *Define* and *Design* into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations during the life time of the website.


### Deploy]

- Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.


### Maintain

- Maintain is remediating *Define*, *Design*,*Develop*, *Deploy*, or Security problems.

## Content

People visit websites for the content. Most access the website using mobile devices. They and others have little tolerance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not 
conform to their screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, functionality, also need to be consistent and complement the content.

## Defect Remediation Costs

Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

Some of the early error detection mechanisms built into the framework are:

- Automatic tools in the `vscode` editor  continually check for syntax and other errors 
- Fast refresh live-editing quickly show changes while typing, and any runtime errors
- Team members may frequently deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback.

## Minimum Viable Product 

 The first goal of the project is get to a Minimum Viable Product. It is a way to understand whether website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in product development with the *must* features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.
 
 The next steps are adding the *want* features, until stakeholders agree the website is ready to deployed to the Internet.
